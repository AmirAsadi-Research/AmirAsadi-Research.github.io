                I'm currently immersing myself in the world of cybernetics as a PhD student at the Australian National University and making strides in robotics as a visiting researcher at the Australian Cobotics Centre, QUT. My academic and professional journey is a tapestry woven from diverse experiences in engineering, from the development of cutting-edge robotics to advancing automotive technologies and creating medical systems that matter.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                My foundation in Electrical Engineering and Control Theory has been the bedrock upon which I've built my career, leading me to explore the fascinating world of cyber-physical systems. These explorations have not only allowed me to contribute to the field through practical applications but also to ponder and propose theoretical frameworks that aim to solve real-world problems. The project that stands out in my journey so far has been the development of a webcam-based rehabilitative game for kids with Cerebral Palsy, a venture that perfectly encapsulates my passion for leveraging technology to enhance health and well-being.

            <div class="body-text">
                Outside the rigour of research and development, I find joy in the intellectual challenge of chess, although I humbly place myself among the ranks of enthusiastic patzers. This game, much like my professional pursuits, reflects my constant quest for learning, strategising, and improving. Through my work and interests, I seek to not only push the boundaries of technology and healthcare but also to inspire and collaborate with others who share a vision for a better, more interconnected world.
            </div>
            <div class="body-text">
                As I continue on this journey, I am driven by the belief that the fusion of robotics, AI, and healthcare can lead to revolutionary advancements. My goal is to contribute to this evolution by developing frameworks and technologies that are not only innovative but also accessible and beneficial to all.
